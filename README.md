# Janell's Portfolio Website

This is the codebase for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects, skills, and experiences as a full stack software engineer. 

The website is built with React and styled with Styled Components.  It is hosted on Netlify.  It is responsive and provides an optimal user experience across different devices.

## Features

- Home: Introduction about myself and skills.
- Resume: A page displaying my resume, with different layouts for desktop and mobile.  This is an embedded iframe.
- Projects: A showcase of my work, featuring different projects I've worked on.  Unfortunately, I can't share my best work with you, because that was for my employers.  This is work I've gotten to do in my spare time.  All of it is a work-in-progress.
